Why TypeScript ?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed at Microsoft by Anders Hejlsberg ( designer of C# ) in the year 2010 and open-sourced in 2012. TypeScript adds a handful of new features to JavaScript and takes it to the next level in modern web development.

There are a lot of advantages if you add TypeScript to your JavaScript-based projects like:

	• You can catch bugs errors during the development phase itself rather than runtime.

	• Debugging is much easier & you will have bug-free production code and feel safe.

	• With static type-checking, it becomes easier for you to spot errors and edge cases.

	• Saves a lot of developer's time in fixing unidentifiable runtime bugs.

	• TypeScript adds advanced features like generics, modules & namespaces.

	• Your projects will be easily understandable by other developers.

	• Your project will have excellent developer experience ( DX ) and team velocity.

	• Helps you write less code than JavaScript & improves readability.

	• Source code documentation will be much better.

	• TypeScript code is easier to refactor and reliable. Hence easier to maintain.

	• Since JavaScript is a subset of TypeScript, you can use all JavaScript libraries.

	• You can incrementally upgrade your JavaScript files on the go.

TypeScript is a powerful tool for large applications
